    <h1>HTTP Today: Fast, Secure, Mobile-Ready</h1>
    <!-- HTTP/2 section: multiplexing, header compression, server push -->
    <h2>HTTP/2 (2015): Speed Boost</h2>
    <p>HTTP/2 addressed mobile-era performance needs with:</p>
    <ul> <!-- Technical features explained in plain language --> 
      <li><strong>Multiplexing</strong> – send many files over one connection</li>
      <li><strong>Header compression (HPACK)</strong> – reduce data size</li>
      <li><strong>Server push</strong> – proactively send assets before the browser asks</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Most sites now require HTTPS to use HTTP/2, reflecting the shift toward secure-by-default design.</p>
    <p>The maturation of HTTP/2 responded to the global shift toward mobile-first experiences, optimizing network resources to provide seamless content delivery even under demanding network conditions.</p>
    <!-- HTTP/3 section: QUIC, UDP, 0-RTT, no head-of-line blocking -->
    <h2>HTTP/3 (2022): Built on QUIC</h2>
    <p>HTTP/3 replaces TCP with <strong>QUIC</strong>, a UDP-based protocol. Benefits include:</p>
    <ul> <!-- Key benefits --> 
      <li>No “head-of-line blocking” – one lost packet doesn’t stall everything</li>
      <li>Faster handshakes – 0-RTT for returning users</li>
      <li>Encryption built-in via TLS 1.3</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Ideal for video calls, gaming, and mobile networks where reliability matters.</p>
    <p>HTTP/3's architecture marks a significant departure from previous versions, emphasizing real-time reliability and encryption as foundational features rather than optional upgrades.</p>
    <!-- HTTPS section: from optional to mandatory, role of Let's Encrypt -->
    <h2>HTTPS: Now the Default</h2>
    <p>Once optional, HTTPS is now standard. Browsers warn users on non-HTTPS sites. Free services like Let’s Encrypt removed cost barriers. Today, HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 won’t even work without encryption—making security foundational, not optional.</p>
    <p>With HTTPS as a default industry standard, data exchange security has become foundational, leading to user trust and confidence in digital interactions.</p>
